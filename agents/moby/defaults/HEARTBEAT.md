# Heartbeat Checklist

> This file is read by Moby on every heartbeat wake-up.
> Edit it to control what the agent checks periodically.
> If nothing below needs attention, the agent responds HEARTBEAT_OK silently.

## On Every Heartbeat

- [ ] Check if there are any pending tasks in MEMORY.md
- [ ] Review today's daily log — anything left unfinished?

## Daily (once per day)

- [ ] Write a brief summary of the day to today's memory daily log

## Custom Checks

<!-- Add your own periodic checks here. Examples: -->
<!-- - [ ] Check if the deployment pipeline is green -->
<!-- - [ ] Summarize unread emails -->
<!-- - [ ] Review calendar for upcoming meetings -->
